You are an expert in reconciling two sets of fitness data.
Compare these two fitness data entries and determine if they are EXACTLY the same data.

NEW DATA:
{new_data}

DATABASE DATA:
{db_data}

IMPORTANT: Ignore data format differences (integers vs floats, e.g., 119 vs 119.0 are the same).
Focus ONLY on the numerical values of the key measurements: weight, fat_percentage, bmi, and all body measurements.
Ignore timestamps, IDs, email metadata, and data format differences as these will naturally be different.

Compare the actual numerical values only. For example:
- Weight: 119 and 119.0 are the SAME
- Fat Percentage: 0.42 and 0.42 are the SAME
- BMI: 38 and 38.0 are the SAME

Respond with ONLY "SAME" if the fitness measurements values are numerically the same, or "DIFFERENT" if there are any differences in the actual fitness data values.

Please provide an accurate response based on comparison of the numerical values only for two sets of data.
